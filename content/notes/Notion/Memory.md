## Remembering Data

An `OR` gate could be used to store a single bit.  
![[image76.png]]  
If the input `A` is changed to `1`, the `OR` gate will output `1`, and then receive it.  
![[image77.png]]  
Even after the input `A` is set to `0`, the output does not change. The `OR` gate "remembers" that, at one point in the past, the `A` input was set to `1`.  
![[image78.png]]  
The inverse can be done with an `AND` gate.  
![[image79.png]]  
To remember either a `1` or a `0`, we can do the following:  
![[image80.png]]  
AND-OR LATCH  
The input `A` sets the output to `1`, and the input `B` sets the output to `0`. This circuit is able to store a bit of information, while powered on, even after both inputs are set to `0`.  
A slightly more advanced and intuitive version can be built as follows:  
![[image81.png]]  
GATED LATCH  
The input `A` is the value to store, and when `B` is set to `1`, the value is stored.  
This is not the only way to store data using logic gates, but it is one of the simplest.

## Registers

A single bit isn't very useful, so we can use the previous circuit to create an 8bit register.

## Binary Decoder

Select which circuit to activate, depending on the task at hand.

## RAM

Registers don't scale well, however, as storing a large amount of data would require millions of wires.  
We can organize latches in a matrix instead of a long, horizontal line.  
![[image84.png]]  
To access a specific latch, binary decoders can be used.  
![[image85.png]]  
This way, a single, short memory address can select any latch in the matrix.

### Reading and Writing to the Matrix

We can modify the latch to reduce the amount of wires needed.  
![[image86.png]]  
This new latch uses the same wire for both input and output.  
![[image87.png]]  
This circuit would store the same value on every latch, which isn't useful. With some modifications, however, we can use the memory address to select which latch to modify.

### Storing Bytes Instead of Bits

![[image90.png]]  
In this example, we can provide 1 byte of information, a `write` or `read` signal, and a memory address. Since we are storing a full byte, the same memory address applies for all 8, single bit circuits.  
This configuration is more commonly known as **RAM**.  
To make it easier to understand, we can abstract these concepts further.  
![[image91.png]]  
The largest the Address Bus is, the more bits can be managed. This is why a 32bit CPU can't manage more than 4Â GB of RAM.  
![[image92.png]]  
This kind of RAM is Static RAM (**S**RAM), which uses many transistors, making it faster, but more expensive to produce than **D**RAM.
