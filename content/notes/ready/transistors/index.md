Transistors are electronic components that behave like a `switch`, or `amplifier`.

## Schematic

```Plain
        .--.,-- Collector
Base --(--|<)
        `--`'-- Emitter
```

## Examples

### Switch

If the `base` pin is provided with energy, the transistor allows current to flow in the main circuit.

### Amplifier

Altering the voltage given to the `base` pin allows us to control a larger voltage in the main circuit.

## Types of Transistor

### NPN

An NPN transistor combines the `base` pin and `collector` pin.

> Note: Even if the collector pin is disconnected from the circuit, a small amount of current still passes through. ![[image3.png]]

### PNP

A PNP transistor receives energy through the `emitter` pin, and then divides it to the remaining pins.
