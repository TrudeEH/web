## Hello World

In Swift, this line of code is a complete program.

```swift
print("Hello, world!")
```

Unlike C, you don't need to import a separate library for functionality like outputting text or handling strings.

Code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program, so you don't need aÂ `main()`Â function.

Swift does not require a `;` at the end of every line.

## Simple Values

UseÂ `let`Â to make a constant andÂ `var`Â to make a variable.

The value of a constant doesn't need to be known at compile time, but you must assign it a value exactly once.

This means you can use constants to name a value that you determine once but use in many places.

```swift
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50

let myConstant = 42
```

Data types don't always have to write the type explicitly. Providing a value when you create a constant or variable lets the compiler infer its type. In the example above, the compiler infers thatÂ `myVariable`Â is an integer because its initial value is an integer.

If the initial value doesn't provide enough information (or if there isn't an initial value), specify the type by writing it after the variable, separated by a colon.

```swift
let implicitInteger = 70
let implicitDouble = 70.0

let explicitDouble: Double = 70
```

Values are never implicitly converted to another type. If you need to convert a value to a different type, explicitly make an instance of the desired type.

```swift
let label = "The width is "
let width = 94
let widthLabel = label + String(width)
```

If the conversion toÂ `String`Â from the last line is removed, the compiler throws an error:

```
Binary operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'String' and 'Int'
```

There's also a simpler way to include values in strings:

```swift
let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \\(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \\(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
```

Use three double quotation marks (`"""`) for strings that take up multiple lines. Indentation at the start of each quoted line is removed, as long as it matches the indentation of the closing quotation marks. For example:

```swift
let quotation = """
        Even though there's whitespace to the left,
        the actual lines aren't indented.
            Except for this line.
        Double quotes (") can appear without being escaped.
        I still have \\(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit.
        """
```

Create arrays and dictionaries using brackets (`[]`), and access their elements by writing the index or key in brackets. A comma is allowed after the last element.

```swift
var fruits = ["strawberries", "limes", "tangerines"]
fruits[1] = "grapes"

var occupations = [
    "Malcolm": "Captain",
    "Kaylee": "Mechanic",
]
occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations"
```

Arrays automatically grow as you add elements.

```swift
fruits.append("blueberries")
print(fruits)
// Prints "["strawberries", "grapes", "tangerines", "blueberries"]"
```

You also use brackets to write an empty array or dictionary. For an array, writeÂ `[]`, and for a dictionary, writeÂ `[:]`.

```swift
fruits = []
occupations = [:]
```

If you're assigning an empty array or dictionary to a new variable, or another place where there isn't any type information, you need to specify the type.

```swift
let emptyArray: [String] = []
let emptyDictionary: [String: Float] = [:]
```

## Control Flow

UseÂ `if`Â andÂ `switch`Â to make conditionals, and useÂ `for`-`in`,Â `while`, andÂ `repeat`-`while`Â to make loops.

Parentheses around the condition or loop variable are optional. Braces around the body are required.

```swift
let individualScores = [75, 43, 103, 87, 12]
var teamScore = 0

for score in individualScores {
	if score > 50 {
		teamScore += 3
  } else {
    teamScore += 1
  }
}

print(teamScore)// Prints "11"
```

In anÂ `if`Â statement, the conditional must be a Boolean expression â€” this means that code such asÂ `if score { ... }`Â is an error, not an implicit comparison to zero.

You can writeÂ `if`Â orÂ `switch`Â after the equal sign (`=`) of an assignment or afterÂ `return`, to choose a value based on the condition.

```swift
let scoreDecoration = if teamScore > 10 { "ðŸŽ‰" } else {""}

print("Score:", teamScore, scoreDecoration)// Prints "Score: 11 ðŸŽ‰"
```

You can useÂ `if`Â andÂ `let`Â together to work with values that might be missing. These values are represented as optionals. An optional value either contains a value or containsÂ `nil`Â to indicate that a value is missing. Write a question mark (`?`) after the type of a value to mark the value as optional.

```swift
var optionalString: String? = "Hello"
print(optionalString == nil)// Prints "false"

var optionalName: String? = "John Appleseed"
var greeting = "Hello!"

if let name = optionalName {
	greeting = "Hello, \\(name)"
}
```

If the optional value isÂ `nil`, the conditional isÂ `false`Â and the code in braces is skipped. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped and assigned to the constant afterÂ `let`, which makes the unwrapped value available inside the block of code.

Another way to handle optional values is to provide a default value using theÂ `??`Â operator. If the optional value is missing, the default value is used instead.

```swift
let nickname: String? = nil
let fullName: String = "John Appleseed"

let informalGreeting = "Hi \\(nickname ?? fullName)"
```

You can use a shorter spelling to unwrap a value, using the same name for that unwrapped value.

```swift
if let nickname {
	print("Hey, \\(nickname)")
}// Doesn't print anything, because nickname is nil.
```

Switches support any kind of data and a wide variety of comparison operations â€” they aren't limited to integers and tests for equality.

```swift
let vegetable = "red pepper"

switch vegetable {
	case "celery":
		print("Add some raisins and make ants on a log.")
	case "cucumber", "watercress":
		print("That would make a good tea sandwich.")
	case let x where x.hasSuffix("pepper"):
	  print("Is it a spicy \\(x)?")
	default:
		print("Everything tastes good in soup.")
}// Prints "Is it a spicy red pepper?"
```

Notice howÂ `let`Â can be used in a pattern to assign the value that matched the pattern to a constant.

After executing the code inside the switch case that matched, the program exits from the switch statement. Execution doesn't continue to the next case, so you don't need to explicitly break out of the switch at the end of each case's code.

You useÂ `for`-`in`Â to iterate over items in a dictionary by providing a pair of names to use for each key-value pair. Dictionaries are an unordered collection, so their keys and values are iterated over in an arbitrary order.

```swift
let interestingNumbers = [
	"Prime": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13],
	"Fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8],
	"Square": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25],
]

var largest = 0
for (_, numbers) in interestingNumbers {
	for number in numbers {
		if number > largest { largest = number }    
	}
}
print(largest)// Prints "25"
```

TheÂ `_`Â character is a placeholder; It can be useful when it is not necessary to keep track of the loop iterations. It could be omitted in this example.

UseÂ `while`Â to repeat a block of code until a condition changes. The condition of a loop can be at the end instead, ensuring that the loop is run at least once.

```swift
var n = 2
while n < 100 {
	n *= 2
}
print(n)// Prints "128"

var m = 2
repeat {
	m *= 2
} while m < 100
print(m)// Prints "128"
```

If you change the condition fromÂ `m < 100`Â toÂ `m < 0`, `while`Â andÂ `repeat`-`while` behave differently, as `repeat`-`while` would still execute once, even if the condition was already false.

You can keep an index in a loop by usingÂ `..<`Â to make a range of indexes.

```swift
var total = 0
for i in 0..<4 { total += i}
print(total)// Prints "6"
```

UseÂ `..<`Â to make a range that omits its upper value, and useÂ `...`Â to make a range that includes both values.

### [Functions and Closures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/#Functions-and-Closures)

UseÂ `func`Â to declare a function. Call a function by following its name with a list of arguments in parentheses. UseÂ `->`Â to separate the parameter names and types from the function's return type.

`func greet(person: String, day: String) -> String { return "Hello \\(person), today is \\(day)."}greet(person: "Bob", day: "Tuesday")`

**Experiment** Remove theÂ `day`Â parameter. Add a parameter to include today's lunch special in the greeting.

By default, functions use their parameter names as labels for their arguments. Write a custom argument label before the parameter name, or writeÂ `_`Â to use no argument label.

`func greet(_ person: String, on day: String) -> String { return "Hello \\(person), today is \\(day)."}greet("John", on: "Wednesday")`

Use a tuple to make a compound value â€” for example, to return multiple values from a function. The elements of a tuple can be referred to either by name or by number.

`func calculateStatistics(scores: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int, sum: Int) { var min = scores[0] var max = scores[0] var sum = 0 for score in scores { if score > max { max = score } else if score < min { min = score } sum += score } return (min, max, sum)}let statistics = calculateStatistics(scores: [5, 3, 100, 3, 9])print(statistics.sum)// Prints "120"print(statistics.2)// Prints "120"`

Functions can be nested. Nested functions have access to variables that were declared in the outer function. You can use nested functions to organize the code in a function that's long or complex.

`func returnFifteen() -> Int { var y = 10 func add() { y += 5 } add() return y}returnFifteen()`

Functions are a first-class type. This means that a function can return another function as its value.

`func makeIncrementer() -> ((Int) -> Int) { func addOne(number: Int) -> Int { return 1 + number } return addOne}var increment = makeIncrementer()increment(7)`

A function can take another function as one of its arguments.

`func hasAnyMatches(list: [Int], condition: (Int) -> Bool) -> Bool { for item in list { if condition(item) { return true } } return false}func lessThanTen(number: Int) -> Bool { return number < 10}var numbers = [20, 19, 7, 12]hasAnyMatches(list: numbers, condition: lessThanTen)`

Functions are actually a special case of closures: blocks of code that can be called later. The code in a closure has access to things like variables and functions that were available in the scope where the closure was created, even if the closure is in a different scope when it's executed â€” you saw an example of this already with nested functions. You can write a closure without a name by surrounding code with braces (`{}`). UseÂ `in`Â to separate the arguments and return type from the body.

`numbers.map({ (number: Int) -> Int in let result = 3 * number return result})`

**Experiment** Rewrite the closure to return zero for all odd numbers.

You have several options for writing closures more concisely. When a closure's type is already known, such as the callback for a delegate, you can omit the type of its parameters, its return type, or both. Single statement closures implicitly return the value of their only statement.

`let mappedNumbers = numbers.map({ number in 3 * number })print(mappedNumbers)// Prints "[60, 57, 21, 36]"`

You can refer to parameters by number instead of by name â€” this approach is especially useful in very short closures. A closure passed as the last argument to a function can appear immediately after the parentheses. When a closure is the only argument to a function, you can omit the parentheses entirely.

`let sortedNumbers = numbers.sorted { $0 > $1 }print(sortedNumbers)// Prints "[20, 19, 12, 7]"`

### [Objects and Classes](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/#Objects-and-Classes)

UseÂ `class`Â followed by the class's name to create a class. A property declaration in a class is written the same way as a constant or variable declaration, except that it's in the context of a class. Likewise, method and function declarations are written the same way.

`class Shape { var numberOfSides = 0 func simpleDescription() -> String { return "A shape with \\(numberOfSides) sides." }}`

**Experiment** Add a constant property withÂ `let`, and add another method that takes an argument.

Create an instance of a class by putting parentheses after the class name. Use dot syntax to access the properties and methods of the instance.

`var shape = Shape()shape.numberOfSides = 7var shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription()`

This version of theÂ `Shape`Â class is missing something important: an initializer to set up the class when an instance is created. UseÂ `init`Â to create one.

`class NamedShape { var numberOfSides: Int = 0 var name: String init(name: String) { self.name = name } func simpleDescription() -> String { return "A shape with \\(numberOfSides) sides." }}`

Notice howÂ `self`Â is used to distinguish theÂ `name`Â property from theÂ `name`Â argument to the initializer. The arguments to the initializer are passed like a function call when you create an instance of the class. Every property needs a value assigned â€” either in its declaration (as withÂ `numberOfSides`) or in the initializer (as withÂ `name`).

UseÂ `deinit`Â to create a deinitializer if you need to perform some cleanup before the object is deallocated.

Subclasses include their superclass name after their class name, separated by a colon. There's no requirement for classes to subclass any standard root class, so you can include or omit a superclass as needed.

Methods on a subclass that override the superclass's implementation are marked withÂ `override`Â â€” overriding a method by accident, withoutÂ `override`, is detected by the compiler as an error. The compiler also detects methods withÂ `override`Â that don't actually override any method in the superclass.

`class Square: NamedShape { var sideLength: Double init(sideLength: Double, name: String) { self.sideLength = sideLength super.init(name: name) numberOfSides = 4 } func area() -> Double { return sideLength * sideLength } override func simpleDescription() -> String { return "A square with sides of length \\(sideLength)." }}let test = Square(sideLength: 5.2, name: "my test square")test.area()test.simpleDescription()`

**Experiment** Make another subclass ofÂ `NamedShape`Â calledÂ `Circle`Â that takes a radius and a name as arguments to its initializer. Implement anÂ `area()`Â and aÂ `simpleDescription()`Â method on theÂ `Circle`Â class.

In addition to simple properties that are stored, properties can have a getter and a setter.

`class EquilateralTriangle: NamedShape { var sideLength: Double = 0.0 init(sideLength: Double, name: String) { self.sideLength = sideLength super.init(name: name) numberOfSides = 3 } var perimeter: Double { get { return 3.0 * sideLength } set { sideLength = newValue / 3.0 } } override func simpleDescription() -> String { return "An equilateral triangle with sides of length \\(sideLength)." }}var triangle = EquilateralTriangle(sideLength: 3.1, name: "a triangle")print(triangle.perimeter)// Prints "9.3"triangle.perimeter = 9.9print(triangle.sideLength)// Prints "3.3000000000000003"`

In the setter forÂ `perimeter`, the new value has the implicit nameÂ `newValue`. You can provide an explicit name in parentheses afterÂ `set`.

Notice that the initializer for theÂ `EquilateralTriangle`Â class has three different steps:

1. Setting the value of properties that the subclass declares.
2. Calling the superclass's initializer.
3. Changing the value of properties defined by the superclass. Any additional setup work that uses methods, getters, or setters can also be done at this point.

If you don't need to compute the property but still need to provide code that's run before and after setting a new value, useÂ `willSet`Â andÂ `didSet`. The code you provide is run any time the value changes outside of an initializer. For example, the class below ensures that the side length of its triangle is always the same as the side length of its square.

`class TriangleAndSquare { var triangle: EquilateralTriangle { willSet { square.sideLength = newValue.sideLength } } var square: Square { willSet { triangle.sideLength = newValue.sideLength } } init(size: Double, name: String) { square = Square(sideLength: size, name: name) triangle = EquilateralTriangle(sideLength: size, name: name) }}var triangleAndSquare = TriangleAndSquare(size: 10, name: "another test shape")print(triangleAndSquare.square.sideLength)// Prints "10.0"print(triangleAndSquare.triangle.sideLength)// Prints "10.0"triangleAndSquare.square = Square(sideLength: 50, name: "larger square")print(triangleAndSquare.triangle.sideLength)// Prints "50.0"`

When working with optional values, you can writeÂ `?`Â before operations like methods, properties, and subscripting. If the value before theÂ `?`Â isÂ `nil`, everything after theÂ `?`Â is ignored and the value of the whole expression isÂ `nil`. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped, and everything after theÂ `?`Â acts on the unwrapped value. In both cases, the value of the whole expression is an optional value.

`let optionalSquare: Square? = Square(sideLength: 2.5, name: "optional square")let sideLength = optionalSquare?.sideLength`

### [Enumerations and Structures](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/#Enumerations-and-Structures)

UseÂ `enum`Â to create an enumeration. Like classes and all other named types, enumerations can have methods associated with them.

`enum Rank: Int { case ace = 1 case two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten case jack, queen, king func simpleDescription() -> String { switch self { case .ace: return "ace" case .jack: return "jack" case .queen: return "queen" case .king: return "king" default: return String(self.rawValue) } }}let ace = Rank.acelet aceRawValue = ace.rawValue`

**Experiment** Write a function that compares twoÂ `Rank`Â values by comparing their raw values.

By default, Swift assigns the raw values starting at zero and incrementing by one each time, but you can change this behavior by explicitly specifying values. In the example above,Â `Ace`Â is explicitly given a raw value ofÂ `1`, and the rest of the raw values are assigned in order. You can also use strings or floating-point numbers as the raw type of an enumeration. Use theÂ `rawValue`Â property to access the raw value of an enumeration case.

Use theÂ `init?(rawValue:)`Â initializer to make an instance of an enumeration from a raw value. It returns either the enumeration case matching the raw value orÂ `nil`Â if there's no matchingÂ `Rank`.

`if let convertedRank = Rank(rawValue: 3) { let threeDescription = convertedRank.simpleDescription()}`

The case values of an enumeration are actual values, not just another way of writing their raw values. In fact, in cases where there isn't a meaningful raw value, you don't have to provide one.

`enum Suit { case spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs func simpleDescription() -> String { switch self { case .spades: return "spades" case .hearts: return "hearts" case .diamonds: return "diamonds" case .clubs: return "clubs" } }}let hearts = Suit.heartslet heartsDescription = hearts.simpleDescription()`

**Experiment** Add aÂ `color()`Â method toÂ `Suit`Â that returns "black" for spades and clubs, and returns "red" for hearts and diamonds.

Notice the two ways that theÂ `hearts`Â case of the enumeration is referred to above: When assigning a value to theÂ `hearts`Â constant, the enumeration caseÂ `Suit.hearts`Â is referred to by its full name because the constant doesn't have an explicit type specified. Inside the switch, the enumeration case is referred to by the abbreviated formÂ `.hearts`Â because the value ofÂ `self`Â is already known to be a suit. You can use the abbreviated form anytime the value's type is already known.

If an enumeration has raw values, those values are determined as part of the declaration, which means every instance of a particular enumeration case always has the same raw value. Another choice for enumeration cases is to have values associated with the case â€” these values are determined when you make the instance, and they can be different for each instance of an enumeration case. You can think of the associated values as behaving like stored properties of the enumeration case instance. For example, consider the case of requesting the sunrise and sunset times from a server. The server either responds with the requested information, or it responds with a description of what went wrong.

`enum ServerResponse { case result(String, String) case failure(String)} let success = ServerResponse.result("6:00 am", "8:09 pm")let failure = ServerResponse.failure("Out of cheese.") switch success {case let .result(sunrise, sunset): print("Sunrise is at \\(sunrise) and sunset is at \\(sunset).")case let .failure(message): print("Failure... \\(message)")}// Prints "Sunrise is at 6:00 am and sunset is at 8:09 pm."`

**Experiment** Add a third case toÂ `ServerResponse`Â and to the switch.

Notice how the sunrise and sunset times are extracted from theÂ `ServerResponse`Â value as part of matching the value against the switch cases.

UseÂ `struct`Â to create a structure. Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they're passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.

`struct Card { var rank: Rank var suit: Suit func simpleDescription() -> String { return "The \\(rank.simpleDescription()) of \\(suit.simpleDescription())" }}let threeOfSpades = Card(rank: .three, suit: .spades)let threeOfSpadesDescription = threeOfSpades.simpleDescription()`

**Experiment** Write a function that returns an array containing a full deck of cards, with one card of each combination of rank and suit.

### [Concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/#Concurrency)

UseÂ `async`Â to mark a function that runs asynchronously.

`func fetchUserID(from server: String) async -> Int { if server == "primary" { return 97 } return 501}`

You mark a call to an asynchronous function by writingÂ `await`Â in front of it.

`func fetchUsername(from server: String) async -> String { let userID = await fetchUserID(from: server) if userID == 501 { return "John Appleseed" } return "Guest"}`

UseÂ `async let`Â to call an asynchronous function, letting it run in parallel with other asynchronous code. When you use the value it returns, writeÂ `await`.

`func connectUser(to server: String) async { async let userID = fetchUserID(from: server) async let username = fetchUsername(from: server) let greeting = await "Hello \\(username), user ID \\(userID)" print(greeting)}`

UseÂ `Task`Â to call asynchronous functions from synchronous code, without waiting for them to return.

`Task { await connectUser(to: "primary")}// Prints "Hello Guest, user ID 97"`

Use task groups to structure concurrent code.

`let userIDs = await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group in for server in ["primary", "secondary", "development"] { group.addTask { return await fetchUserID(from: server) } } var results: [Int] = [] for await result in group { results.append(result) } return results}`

Actors are similar to classes, except they ensure that different asynchronous functions can safely interact with an instance of the same actor at the same time.

`actor ServerConnection { var server: String = "primary" private var activeUsers: [Int] = [] func connect() async -> Int { let userID = await fetchUserID(from: server) // ... communicate with server ... activeUsers.append(userID) return userID }}`

When you call a method on an actor or access one of its properties, you mark that code withÂ `await`Â to indicate that it might have to wait for other code that's already running on the actor to finish.

`let server = ServerConnection()let userID = await server.connect()`

### [Protocols and Extensions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/#Protocols-and-Extensions)

UseÂ `protocol`Â to declare a protocol.

`protocol ExampleProtocol { var simpleDescription: String { get } mutating func adjust()}`

Classes, enumerations, and structures can all adopt protocols.

`class SimpleClass: ExampleProtocol { var simpleDescription: String = "A very simple class." var anotherProperty: Int = 69105 func adjust() { simpleDescription += " Now 100% adjusted." }}var a = SimpleClass()a.adjust()let aDescription = a.simpleDescription struct SimpleStructure: ExampleProtocol { var simpleDescription: String = "A simple structure" mutating func adjust() { simpleDescription += " (adjusted)" }}var b = SimpleStructure()b.adjust()let bDescription = b.simpleDescription`

**Experiment** Add another requirement toÂ `ExampleProtocol`. What changes do you need to make toÂ `SimpleClass`Â andÂ `SimpleStructure`Â so that they still conform to the protocol?

Notice the use of theÂ `mutating`Â keyword in the declaration ofÂ `SimpleStructure`Â to mark a method that modifies the structure. The declaration ofÂ `SimpleClass`Â doesn't need any of its methods marked as mutating because methods on a class can always modify the class.

UseÂ `extension`Â to add functionality to an existing type, such as new methods and computed properties. You can use an extension to add protocol conformance to a type that's declared elsewhere, or even to a type that you imported from a library or framework.

`extension Int: ExampleProtocol { var simpleDescription: String { return "The number \\(self)" } mutating func adjust() { self += 42 } }print(7.simpleDescription)// Prints "The number 7"`

**Experiment** Write an extension for theÂ `Double`Â type that adds anÂ `absoluteValue`Â property.

You can use a protocol name just like any other named type â€” for example, to create a collection of objects that have different types but that all conform to a single protocol. When you work with values whose type is a boxed protocol type, methods outside the protocol definition aren't available.

`let protocolValue: any ExampleProtocol = aprint(protocolValue.simpleDescription)// Prints "A very simple class. Now 100% adjusted."// print(protocolValue.anotherProperty) // Uncomment to see the error`

Even though the variableÂ `protocolValue`Â has a runtime type ofÂ `SimpleClass`, the compiler treats it as the given type ofÂ `ExampleProtocol`. This means that you can't accidentally access methods or properties that the class implements in addition to its protocol conformance.

### [Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/#Error-Handling)

You represent errors using any type that adopts theÂ `Error`Â protocol.

`enum PrinterError: Error { case outOfPaper case noToner case onFire}`

UseÂ `throw`Â to throw an error andÂ `throws`Â to mark a function that can throw an error. If you throw an error in a function, the function returns immediately and the code that called the function handles the error.

`func send(job: Int, toPrinter printerName: String) throws -> String { if printerName == "Never Has Toner" { throw PrinterError.noToner } return "Job sent"}`

There are several ways to handle errors. One way is to useÂ `do`-`catch`. Inside theÂ `do`Â block, you mark code that can throw an error by writingÂ `try`Â in front of it. Inside theÂ `catch`Â block, the error is automatically given the nameÂ `error`Â unless you give it a different name.

`do { let printerResponse = try send(job: 1040, toPrinter: "Bi Sheng") print(printerResponse)} catch { print(error)}// Prints "Job sent"`

**Experiment** Change the printer name toÂ `"Never Has Toner"`, so that theÂ `send(job:toPrinter:)`Â function throws an error.

You can provide multipleÂ `catch`Â blocks that handle specific errors. You write a pattern afterÂ `catch`Â just as you do afterÂ `case`Â in a switch.

`do { let printerResponse = try send(job: 1440, toPrinter: "Gutenberg") print(printerResponse)} catch PrinterError.onFire { print("I'll just put this over here, with the rest of the fire.")} catch let printerError as PrinterError { print("Printer error: \\(printerError).")} catch { print(error)}// Prints "Job sent"`

**Experiment** Add code to throw an error inside theÂ `do`Â block. What kind of error do you need to throw so that the error is handled by the firstÂ `catch`Â block? What about the second and third blocks?

Another way to handle errors is to useÂ `try?`Â to convert the result to an optional. If the function throws an error, the specific error is discarded and the result isÂ `nil`. Otherwise, the result is an optional containing the value that the function returned.

`let printerSuccess = try? send(job: 1884, toPrinter: "Mergenthaler")let printerFailure = try? send(job: 1885, toPrinter: "Never Has Toner")`

UseÂ `defer`Â to write a block of code that's executed after all other code in the function, just before the function returns. The code is executed regardless of whether the function throws an error. You can useÂ `defer`Â to write setup and cleanup code next to each other, even though they need to be executed at different times.

`var fridgeIsOpen = falselet fridgeContent = ["milk", "eggs", "leftovers"] func fridgeContains(_ food: String) -> Bool { fridgeIsOpen = true defer { fridgeIsOpen = false } let result = fridgeContent.contains(food) return result}if fridgeContains("banana") { print("Found a banana")}print(fridgeIsOpen)// Prints "false"`

### [Generics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/#Generics)

Write a name inside angle brackets to make a generic function or type.

`func makeArray<Item>(repeating item: Item, numberOfTimes: Int) -> [Item] { var result: [Item] = [] for _ in 0..<numberOfTimes { result.append(item) } return result}makeArray(repeating: "knock", numberOfTimes: 4)`

You can make generic forms of functions and methods, as well as classes, enumerations, and structures.

`// Reimplement the Swift standard library's optional typeenum OptionalValue<Wrapped> { case none case some(Wrapped)}var possibleInteger: OptionalValue<Int> = .nonepossibleInteger = .some(100)`

UseÂ `where`Â right before the body to specify a list of requirements â€” for example, to require the type to implement a protocol, to require two types to be the same, or to require a class to have a particular superclass.

`func anyCommonElements<T: Sequence, U: Sequence>(_ lhs: T, _ rhs: U) -> Bool where T.Element: Equatable, T.Element == U.Element{ for lhsItem in lhs { for rhsItem in rhs { if lhsItem == rhsItem { return true } } } return false}anyCommonElements([1, 2, 3], [3])`

**Experiment** Modify theÂ `anyCommonElements(_:_:)`Â function to make a function that returns an array of the elements that any two sequences have in common.

WritingÂ `<T: Equatable>`Â is the same as writingÂ `<T> ... where T: Equatable`.
